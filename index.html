				<p>	Now the most significant extinction of plant and animal species in the last 65 million years is taking place, degradation and death of many valuable resource 
					communities are observed: 
					first of all, tropical forests, in which up to 200 species of woody plants alone can be found on an area of 1 hectare, not counting thousands of animal species.
				</p>
				<p id="1">
					The rate of extinction of species exceeds the natural course of evolution by an average of 5000 times. According to various estimates, up to 10 million species exist on Earth. With this rate of species extinction, it is highly likely that half of the species of terrestrial organisms could become extinct in the next 50 years.
				    Every year, the list of rare plants listed in the Red Book is replenished.
				</p>
				<p>The Red Book, in addition to the legal component, shows the current state of plants and animals in a particular region Plants of the Red Book - plants that we may no longer see, these are species that require special treatment from us. Unfortunately, the protection measures being developed do not always bring the expected result. Saving rare plants without changing our self-consciousness is not possible.

				<p>Category and status: 1 - endangered species. Tertiary relic, the only representative of the genus in Russia. In Russia, it is located on the northern border of the range.</p>

				<p>A brief description of. Perennial herbaceous polycarp, with a thickened main tap root, usually branched. Under natural conditions, it reproduces mainly by seeds that germinate in the 2-3rd year, in rare cases - vegetatively (1, 2). The seeds are spread by birds. Young plants develop very slowly. The first flowering occurs in the 8-10th year. An important feature of biology is the ability to sink into a state of secondary dormancy from one to several decades under the influence of unfavorable factors. The total lifespan of a plant under natural conditions can reach 100-140 years (3).</p>
